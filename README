PON_IP mailbox driver

This driver exposes the mailbox management interface of the MaxLinear PON_IP to
the user space. It allows to send arbitrary messages to the PON IP and
receives answers and arbitrary events from the PON_IP. It exposes a netlink
interface, applications can use. This interface can be used by multiple
applications in parallel.
In addition it allows applications to reset the PON_IP and load arbitrary
firmware into the PON_IP core.

Available compilation options:
- DEBUG
  This will enable debug logging in the mailbox driver.
- SKIP_TEP
  On PRX300 this option skips the operations which need the TEP.
  When this option is set the pon_mbox_drv will *not* try to
  unlock the PON IP before downloading the PON IP FW.

  On URX800 this option skips the PON FW download locking.
  Without this option, PON FW can only be downloaded one-time after board
  startup. Any further PON FW download afterwards is blocked. PON debugging
  is not possible as well.
